3. **Mock Data**: Prepare realistic test data for demo purposes
4. **Incremental Testing**: Test each integration independently before combining

## Cross-Chain Integration Analysis

### The Graph Protocol on World Chain - BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY! 🚀

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: World Chain is built on **OP Stack** and is part of the **Superchain ecosystem**!

**Why This Changes Everything**:

- The Graph **already supports** Optimism, Base, and other OP Stack chains
- World Chain uses the **same architecture** as proven, working chains
- OP Stack chains share **common JSON-RPC interfaces** and **data structures**

**Hackathon Feasibility**: **FULLY VIABLE** ✅

**Technical Implementation**:

1. **Existing OP Stack Support**

   - The Graph supports 40+ chains including **Optimism** and **Base**
   - World Chain inherits **same EVM compatibility** and **JSON-RPC methods**
   - **No custom integration required** - use existing patterns

2. **Proven Architecture**
   - Optimism: TVL $500M+, thousands of subgraphs
   - Base: Active ecosystem with Graph integration
   - World Chain: **Same technical foundation**

**Hackathon Implementation Strategy**:

- **Day 1**: Deploy subgraph using **proven OP Stack templates**
- **Day 2**: Index candidate data with **existing Graph patterns**
- **Day 3**: Build recruiter marketplace dashboard with Graph queries
- **Day 4**: Full knowledge graph demonstration with live candidate matching

**Critical for Graph Track**: Recruiter marketplace must be functional in hackathon to demonstrate knowledge graph value!

**No Custom Development Required** - Leverage existing infrastructure!

```graphql
# Example VeriHire Subgraph Schema
type Candidate @entity {
  id: ID!
  worldId: Bytes!
  trustScore: BigInt!
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus!
  employmentVerifications: [EmploymentVerification!]!
    @derivedFrom(field: "candidate")
  skills: [String!]!
  createdAt: BigInt!
}

type EmploymentVerification @entity {
  id: ID!
  candidate: Candidate!
  employer: Bytes!
  verified: Boolean!
  verificationDate: BigInt!
  position: String!
  company: String!
}

type Recruiter @entity {
  id: ID!
  worldId: Bytes!
  company: String!
  jobPostings: [JobPosting!]! @derivedFrom(field: "recruiter")
}

type JobPosting @entity {
  id: ID!
  recruiter: Recruiter!
  title: String!
  requirements: [String!]!
  matches: [CandidateMatch!]! @derivedFrom(field: "job")
}

type CandidateMatch @entity {
  id: ID!
  candidate: Candidate!
  job: JobPosting!
  matchScore: BigInt!
  timestamp: BigInt!
}
```

**Post-Hackathon Integration**:

- **Immediate**: Full Graph Protocol support (World Chain is OP Stack-compatible)
- **No waiting period**: Use existing Optimism/Base subgraph infrastructure
- **Timeline**: Production-ready within hackathon timeframe

### Self Protocol Cross-Chain Compatibility

**Current Limitation**: Self Protocol is currently only available on Celo, not World Chain.

**Technical Challenge**: We need ZK verifiable credentials exclusively on World Chain for hackathon goals.

**Solution Options**:

#### Option 1: Custom ZK Credential System (Recommended for Hackathon)

Build a simplified ZK credential system natively on World Chain:

```solidity
// Simplified ZK Credential Contract
contract TrustCredential {
    struct Credential {
        bytes32 credentialHash;
        uint256 trustScore;
        uint256 issuanceDate;
        bool isValid;
    }

    mapping(address => Credential) public credentials;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public nullifierHashes;

    function issueCredential(
        bytes32 _credentialHash,
        uint256 _trustScore,
        bytes32 _nullifierHash
    ) external {
        require(!nullifierHashes[_nullifierHash], "Nullifier already used");

        credentials[msg.sender] = Credential({
            credentialHash: _credentialHash,
            trustScore: _trustScore,
            issuanceDate: block.timestamp,
            isValid: true
        });

        nullifierHashes[_nullifierHash] = true;
    }

    function verifyCredential(address _holder) external view returns (bool) {
        return credentials[_holder].isValid;
    }
}
```

**Implementation Details**:

- **Commitment Scheme**: Use Pedersen commitments for privacy
- **Merkle Trees**: Store verification proofs in Merkle tree structure
- **Selective Disclosure**: Allow revealing specific fields without full credential
- **Revocation**: Implement credential revocation mechanisms

#### Option 2: Cross-Chain Bridge (Future Enhancement)

For production, implement a bridge between Self Protocol on Celo and World Chain:

```typescript
// Cross-chain credential verification
interface CrossChainCredential {
  celoCredentialHash: string;
  worldChainProof: string;
  bridgeSignature: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

async function bridgeCredential(
  celoCredential: SelfProtocolCredential,
  worldChainAddress: string,
): Promise<CrossChainCredential> {
  // Verify credential on Celo
  const celoVerification = await selfProtocol.verify(celoCredential);

  // Generate World Chain proof
  const worldChainProof = await generateWorldChainProof(celoVerification);

  // Bridge signature
  const bridgeSignature = await bridgeOracle.sign(worldChainProof);

  return {
    celoCredentialHash: celoCredential.hash,
    worldChainProof,
    bridgeSignature,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };
}
```

#### Option 3: Wait for Self Protocol Expansion

Self Protocol recently launched (February 2025) and may expand to World Chain:

- **Timeline**: 6-12 months for additional chain support
- **Approach**: Coordinate with Self Protocol team for World Chain integration
- **Benefits**: Native ZK credentials with W3C compliance

**Hackathon Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (Custom ZK System) for immediate implementation, design for future Self Protocol integration.

### Technical Implementation for Hackathon

**Day 1-2: Custom ZK Credential Foundation**

```typescript
// Simplified ZK proof generation
import { poseidon } from "circomlib";

interface EmploymentProof {
  employer: string;
  verified: boolean;
  position: string;
  startDate: number;
  endDate: number;
}

function generateEmploymentProof(
  employmentData: EmploymentProof,
  salt: string,
): string {
  const commitment = poseidon([
    employmentData.employer,
    employmentData.verified ? 1 : 0,
    employmentData.position,
    employmentData.startDate,
    employmentData.endDate,
    salt,
  ]);

  return commitment.toString();
}
```

**Day 3-4: World Chain Integration**

```solidity
// Soul-bound NFT with ZK credential reference
contract TrustMatchNFT is ERC5192 {
    struct TrustProfile {
        bytes32 credentialHash;
        uint256 trustScore;
        uint256 verificationCount;
        bool isActive;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => TrustProfile) public profiles;

    function mintTrustNFT(
        address to,
        bytes32 credentialHash,
        uint256 trustScore
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;

        profiles[tokenId] = TrustProfile({
            credentialHash: credentialHash,
            trustScore: trustScore,
            verificationCount: 1,
            isActive: true
        });

        _mint(to, tokenId);
        return tokenId;
    }
}
```
