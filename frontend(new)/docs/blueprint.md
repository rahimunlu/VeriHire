# **App Name**: VeriHire Mobile

## Core Features:

- Mobile UI: Mobile-First Design: Adherence to a mobile-first philosophy with layouts optimized for phones (320–480px width), utilizing UI patterns like stacked cards, swipeable carousels, and bottom sheets.
- Simple Navigation: Simplified Navigation: Implementing ultra-simple, linear navigation using single-handed reach zones, bottom tab bars, or sticky buttons. Modal-based flows will display progress indicators with 'Back' and 'Exit' actions.
- Consistent Components: Consistent UI Elements: Usage of cards, buttons, and modals with rounded corners (16–24px) and light shadows; pill-style buttons with large tap targets; minimal vector-based icons; and ample whitespace.
- Universal Design: Accessibility and Internationalization: Design with high color contrast, readable font sizes, large tap areas, text alternatives for icons, and support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, localization, biometric authentication, and session handling.
- Graceful States: Loading and Error States: Implementing animated skeletons for loading states and toast banners (coral for errors, mint/lilac for success), ensuring animations are smooth and fast (180–250ms).
- Guided flows: Progressive Flows: UI patterns for clear messaging and process. Progressive disclosure restricts the visibility to only necessary components

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gentle Lilac (#A095FF), providing a sense of calm and trust appropriate for financial and identity verification tasks. The subdued tone is intentional, keeping the visual design unobtrusive.
- Background color: Soft Gray (#F7F9FC), a very light desaturated version of the primary hue, helps maintain a clean and bright aesthetic that minimizes distractions. Its brightness aligns with a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Warm Coral (#FF8566) creates highlights and signals active components. As an analogous color, it creates a pleasant harmony with the lilac, while its greater brightness and saturation make it pop.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable text, ensuring clarity on mobile devices.
- Minimal, high-resolution vector icons from Tabler, Phosphor, or Remix, ensuring scalability and a clean interface.
- Stacked vertical layouts, swipeable elements, and sticky footers, all optimized for one-handed use on mobile devices.
- Micro-interactions (scale/bounce on tap, fade/slide on swipe) and smooth transitions (180–250ms) for an engaging user experience.
